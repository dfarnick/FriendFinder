# FriendFinder

Finding a friend can be tough, ugh! Let's see if you get match up with a few celebs. Kenny Loggins is my personal favorite!

Here's what you have to do in order to enjoy this app. 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory via your CLI.
3. "npm install" this will install the packages/modules.
5. "node server.js" this will start up the server.
6. In the web browser enter localhost:8080/

This will allow you to fill in ALL of the boxes and answer ALL of the questions. 

Give it a try!
